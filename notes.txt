Answers to questions:
----------------------

4. Read over the results, and write a paragraph that explains the pattern you see. 
    How does each function “scale”? Which of the two functions scales better? How can you tell?
     - The funciton utilizing unshift() does not scale very well. The function utilizing push scales better

5. For extra credit, do some review / research on why the slower function is so slow, 
    and summarize the reasoning for this.
    - push has constant O(1) complexity, and unshift() has linear, O(n)
